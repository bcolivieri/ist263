    My name is Benjamin Olivieri. I major in information, management, and technology, with a concentration in information security management. This is my first semester involved in this and I don’t have too many skills or accomplishments with it. I love sports, as I am a huge New England Patriots fan, which is football. I love food, and I actually like any types of it. I don’t dislike any foods.
