                    <p class="dish-text">Let's be honest, chicken parm could be the greatest meal ever. It's quite literally that simple. I decided to start off with this over the typical, fresh igredients of any italian dish, because chicken parm rules the world. Chicken Parmesan is an Italian-American classic that's both comforting and satisfying. It's a simple dish where breaded chicken cutlets are fried until golden and crispy, then topped with a vibrant tomato sauce and a hearty layer of melted mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. This dish is often served over spaghetti, making for a filling and flavorful meal. It's a beloved favorite, perfect for a busy college student looking to impress friends or just enjoy a good home-cooked meal.</p>

                        <p class="dish-text">The ingredients of an Italian dish are like no other. Every meal is so similar in what it's made of. For example, red tomato sauce is used in almost every Italian dish that you've eaten. Italian food is all about keeping it fresh and simple. Think ripe tomatoes, tons of garlic, fresh basil, and good olive oil.  It's about mixing these up in a hundred different ways, but still keeping it super simple and super tasty. It's the kind of cooking where less is more, and fresh is best. </p>

                        <p class="dish-text">Chicken parm and eggplant parm are my go-to comfort foods, no contest. I'm all about hunting down the best versions out there. Whether it's an easy-going spot or some high-end restaurant, I'm there, fork in hand. I take my reviews seriously, breaking down the crispy outer layer, the richness of the sauce, and that crucial cheese pull. These dishes are my faves for a reason, because you literally can't cook it wrong. I've never had a bad bite of either. Follow my food adventures, and I'll tell you where to get the parm that'll change your life. </p>

                            Eggplant Parm is the ultimate comfort dish where slices of this purple veggie are dunked in breadcrumbs, fried until they're perfectly crispy, and then smothered with a tangy tomato sauce. Also topped off with a comforting blanket of melted mozzarella and baked until it's all hot and bubbly. It's like a hug in the form of a dish, cheesy, saucy, and the most satisfying. </p>
