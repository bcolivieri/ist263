                </div>
                <p class="Review-Paragraph">There is this beautiful, BEAUTIFUL, small, town in Massachusetts. It goes by the name of Hull, Ma and it contains one of the best Italian restaurants ever. Let me tell you about their Chicken Parmesan. This place has got it down. The chicken is the kind you'd want after a long day, crispy on the outside, totally tender on the inside. They don't skimp on the sauce either, it's the real deal, with just the right kick of herbs..</p>
                
                <p class="Review-Paragraph">And the cheeseâ€¦oh my goodness. Melted all over the chicken, and it still could be the best cheese I've ever had. It's all melty and golden, basically the dream topping for this dish. Plus, you get this side of spaghetti that's cooked just right, not too soft or too chewy.</p>
                
                <p class="Review-Paragraph">Honestly, this Chicken Parm is a solid win. It's filling, tastes like something your Italian grandma would make if you had one, and it's just plain delicious. Gave it a 9.1 because nothing's perfect, but this was close. If you're around Hull, swing by Mezzo Mare and try it out. You won't be disappointed.</p>
