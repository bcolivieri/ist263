    <h1>Olivieri's Biography</h1>

<body>
<p>
    My name is Benjamin Olivieri. I major in information, management, and technology, with a concentration in information security management. This is my first semester involved in this and I don’t have too many skills or accomplishments with it. I love sports, as I am a huge New England Patriots fan, which is football. I love food, and I actually like any types of it. I don’t dislike any foods.

<p>
    Before college, I thoroughly enjoyed my high school experience. I was a three-sport athlete/captain for the baseball, hockey, and football team. I decided my junior year that I wanted more than just a small town, and I wanted to go to a big school preferably close to home.
<p>
<p>
    The small, little peninsula that sits right on the edge of Boston Harbor, Hull, is where I'm from and where I grew up for my entire life. Still to this day, my family lives there as I go to school here in Syracuse. I have a brother and sister, as well as two parents with my beautiful dog waiting until I go back home for the holiday this year. My family has always supported and stood for me whnever I needed them. I know for sure they miss me dearly while I'm away receiving an education, but I also know that they are even more proud of me because of where I am today. We all attended elementary, middle, and high school in Hull, Massachusetts. We've always been a massive sports family. And, of course, being from Massachusetts we are massive Boston sports fans in every category.

<h2>Personal Info</h2>
<p>
    I am currently 20 years old going on to 21 on December 17. 
    If I am not in class, I am most likely working out or hanging out with friends.
    I am a massive Boston sports fan.
    My favorite sports are baseball and football, and I can't decide which one I like better. 
    I am hoping I do very well this semester, as it is very cruicial for me. 
    I am very excited for this upcoming year.
